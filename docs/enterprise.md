## 🏢 Enterprise Vision

The Enterprise edition of OpenCanvas Pro is designed for mission-critical analytical environments.

It extends beyond standard AutoML functionality by embedding governance, robustness evaluation and structured audit mechanisms.

---

## 📊 Robustness-Oriented Selection (Planned)

Enterprise editions introduce:

- Multi-seed validation
- Performance stability measurement
- Variance-aware model comparison
- Penalization of unstable models

Model performance is evaluated not only by peak metrics, but by reliability under uncertainty.

---

## 🧪 Stress Evaluation (Planned)

Stress testing introduces controlled perturbations to:

- Assess model sensitivity
- Evaluate generalization risk
- Measure resilience under variation

This approach strengthens confidence in deployment decisions.

---

## 📜 Audit & Compliance Support

Enterprise environments support:

- Full transformation logs
- Run lifecycle tracking
- Structured metadata retention
- Compliance-ready reporting

---

## 🎯 Strategic Objective

To provide not just predictive models —  
but defensible, documented, and stable analytical decisions.
