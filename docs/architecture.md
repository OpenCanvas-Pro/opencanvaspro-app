# Architecture Overview

OpenCanvas Pro is structured as a layered analytical system designed to ensure traceability, reproducibility and decision integrity.

The platform follows a staged data evolution model:

Bronze → Silver → Gold

---

## 🥉 Bronze Layer — Raw Data

The Bronze layer represents the original dataset exactly as ingested.

Characteristics:
- No structural modifications
- Profiling of missing values, data types and distributions
- Dataset fingerprint (hash)
- Baseline metadata registration

The Bronze dataset acts as the immutable reference point for audit and reproducibility.

---

## 🥈 Silver Layer — Data Preparation

The Silver layer applies controlled transformations to improve data quality and analytical usability.

Typical operations include:
- Missing value handling
- Outlier filtering
- Schema validation
- Type correction
- Deduplication
- Controlled feature transformation

All transformations are logged and stored as metadata.

---

## 🥇 Gold Layer — Model-Ready Dataset

The Gold layer represents the dataset ready for machine learning.

Operations may include:
- Encoding (e.g., categorical to numerical)
- Scaling (excluding target variables)
- Correlation filtering
- Temporal feature engineering
- Controlled train/test configuration

Each Gold dataset is accompanied by a structured Data Contract.

---

## 📜 Data Contracts

Every transformation step produces metadata describing:

- Dataset hash
- Schema and data types
- Applied transformations
- Statistical reference values
- Temporal configuration (if applicable)

This ensures:

- Reproducibility
- Auditability
- Traceable lineage from raw data to model output

---

## 🧠 Machine Learning Layer

Model training is executed over the Gold dataset.

The architecture supports:

- Deterministic configuration
- Session identifiers (seeds)
- Model comparison
- Structured leaderboard extraction
- Artifact export

Future versions introduce robustness-aware selection and stress validation.

---

## 🔐 Privacy & Deployment Model

OpenCanvas Pro is designed with a privacy-first philosophy.

Enterprise deployments support:

- Local-first execution
- Controlled infrastructure integration
- Data sovereignty preservation
- Offline-capable analytical pipelines

---

## 🔄 Reproducibility by Design

All runs generate structured metadata including:

- Dataset fingerprint
- Configuration signature
- Model metadata
- Evaluation metrics

This enables full reproducibility of analytical workflows.
