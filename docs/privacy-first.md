## 🔐 Privacy as a Structural Principle

OpenCanvas Pro is designed with privacy not as a feature, but as an architectural foundation.

In many machine learning platforms, user data is transferred, stored, and processed within centralized cloud infrastructures. While convenient, this model introduces risks related to:

- Data sovereignty
- Regulatory compliance
- Vendor lock-in
- Long-term governance control

OpenCanvas Pro adopts a different stance.

## 🏛️ Data Ownership

Data remains under user control.

Community editions may operate in hosted environments for experimentation purposes, but Enterprise deployments are designed to support:

- Local-first execution
- Controlled infrastructure integration
- Private network environments
- Offline-capable analytical workflows

---

## 🧭 Strategic Positioning

Privacy-first design enables:

- Regulatory alignment
- Industrial deployment scenarios
- Government and public sector adoption
- Infrastructure-critical environments

This philosophy ensures analytical sovereignty and long-term operational control.

---

## 🎯 The Objective

The goal is not merely to train models.

The goal is to enable decision-ready analytics without compromising data control.
