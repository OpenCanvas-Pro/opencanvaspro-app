## 🔄 Structured Run Lifecycle

OpenCanvas Pro organizes analytical workflows into deterministic stages.

Each run follows a structured lifecycle:

1. Bronze — Raw ingestion
2. Silver — Data preparation
3. Gold — Model-ready dataset
4. Train — Model evaluation
5. Evaluate — Comparative assessment
6. Report — Structured output generation

## 📊 Run States

Each execution may transition through defined states:

- queued
- running
- blocked
- completed
- failed

This structure supports:

- Monitoring
- Orchestration
- Autonomous workflows
- Audit tracking

---

## 🤖 Autopilot Integration

EMILIA Autopilot operates within this lifecycle, enforcing:

- Guardrails
- Transformation constraints
- Decision checkpoints
- Governance validation

Automation is structured — not uncontrolled.

---

## 🧭 Reproducibility

Each run generates:

- Dataset fingerprint
- Configuration signature
- Model metadata
- Evaluation metrics

This ensures deterministic traceability.
