OpenCanvas Pro embeds governance directly into the analytical workflow.

Governance is not an afterthought — it is structural.

## 🎯 Why Governance Matters

Machine learning decisions often impact:

- Financial outcomes
- Infrastructure operations
- Public services
- Regulatory environments

Transparent and reproducible workflows are essential.

---

## 🧬 Data Quality Principles

The platform evaluates dataset integrity across dimensions such as:

- Completeness
- Consistency
- Structural coherence
- Distribution balance

Future versions introduce a formal Data Quality Score (DQS).

---

## 📊 Robustness Awareness (Planned)

Traditional AutoML selects models based on peak performance.

OpenCanvas Pro introduces a robustness-oriented perspective:

- Multi-seed validation
- Stability measurement
- Performance variance analysis
- Stress perturbation testing

The objective is to identify not only high-performing models,
but reliable and stable models under uncertainty.

---

## 📜 Auditability

Every execution produces:

- Structured metadata
- Transformation logs
- Dataset fingerprints
- Reproducible configuration signatures

This enables:

- Traceability
- Compliance support
- Internal audit review
- Regulatory reporting

---

## 🛡️ Decision Integrity

The ultimate objective is not simply model performance.

It is defensible analytical decisions.
