## 🖥️ Why Local-First Matters

Cloud-native platforms offer scalability, but they often reduce control.

OpenCanvas Pro introduces a deployment philosophy designed to preserve infrastructure sovereignty.

---

## 🏗️ Deployment Flexibility

Enterprise editions are designed to support:

- On-premises execution
- Private cloud environments
- Containerized deployment (Docker-ready architecture)
- Controlled artifact storage
- Internal model registries

---

## 🔄 Execution Architecture

The platform separates:

- Orchestration layer
- Execution engine
- Metadata and audit logging

This separation enables flexible deployment models without sacrificing governance.

---

## 🛡️ Risk Mitigation

Local-first design reduces exposure to:

- External data transfer risks
- Infrastructure dependency risks
- Regulatory conflicts

It enables institutions to operate analytical pipelines within their own perimeter.
