## 🤖 What is Autopilot?

Autopilot automates the end-to-end analytical workflow:

1. Data profiling
2. Data preparation
3. Feature engineering
4. Model training
5. Evaluation
6. Reporting

With governance embedded in every step.

## 🧠 Controlled Automation

Autopilot operates within predefined guardrails:

- Target variable protection
- Controlled transformation thresholds
- Data quality validation
- Structural anomaly detection

Automation does not override governance.

---

## 🧪 Community vs Enterprise

Community Autopilot:
- Streamlined automation
- Limited robustness checks
- Lightweight validation

Enterprise Autopilot:
- Advanced robustness validation
- Stress testing
- Full audit logs
- Local-first execution
- Compliance-ready configuration

---

## 📈 Future Capabilities

Planned enhancements include:

- Multi-seed robustness scoring
- Stress-index evaluation
- Stability-based model ranking
- Automated executive reporting
- Policy-aware decision pipelines

---

## 🎯 Vision

E.M.I.L.I.A. Autopilot is designed to move beyond “AutoML”.

The goal is Autonomous, Governed, Decision-Ready Machine Learning.
