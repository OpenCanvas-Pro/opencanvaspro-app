OpenCanvas Pro follows a security-by-design philosophy aligned with its governance-oriented architecture.

---

## 1. Security Principles

- Data minimization
- Temporary processing
- No persistent dataset storage (by default)
- Transparent execution structure
- Infrastructure isolation

---

## 2. Data Processing

- Datasets are processed during active sessions
- No manual access to user datasets occurs
- Logs do not contain dataset contents

---

## 3. Infrastructure

OpenCanvas Pro may rely on managed infrastructure providers for hosting and delivery.

Enterprise deployments are designed to support local-first execution.

---

## 4. Authentication (Future Editions)

When enabled, authentication mechanisms may include:

- OAuth providers
- Token-based authentication
- Secure session handling

---

## 5. Known Limitations

As an actively evolving platform:

- No formal SLA is guaranteed
- Availability may vary
- Resource limits may apply

---

## 6. Responsible Disclosure

If you identify a security vulnerability:

- Do not exploit it
- Report it responsibly via email:

contato@opencanvaspro.com

All reports are reviewed with priority.
